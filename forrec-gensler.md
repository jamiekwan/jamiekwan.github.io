# =============================================================================
# ERA PAGE TEMPLATE (layout: era) — copy this file for new “era” case studies
# =============================================================================
# How to use:
# 1. Duplicate this file (e.g. my-project.md).
# 2. Set `permalink` to the URL slug you want (no leading slash; site becomes /permalink).
# 3. Fill `title` + `oneliner` — they appear in the dark hero.
# 4. Choose ONE hero background: set `bgimage` (loads assets/images/{bgimage}.jpg) OR use
#    `color` with a gradient string. Remove or leave empty the one you don’t use — check
#    era.html if your site expects a specific pattern.
# 5. Logos (optional): `logo_src` + `logo_alt` (+ optional `logo_href`). For a partnership
#    lockup, add `logo_src_2`, `logo_alt_2`, `logo_href_2` — the layout shows [Logo1] + [Logo2].
# 6. Overview column: `time`, `role`, `team` (or `team_structure`), `co_designers` — each
#    is a list of lines.
# 7. Main column: `approach` and `impact` — HTML strings (use <p> tags like below).
# 8. `methodology` is a list of HTML paragraphs; optional `methodology_image`, `_alt`, `_caption`.
# 9. `key_projects`: list of cards with title, url, thumbnail, exec_summary, high_level_impact.
# 10. `insights_tldr` + `insight_groups` — see comments near those keys. Remove sections you
#     don’t need (empty optional blocks can be deleted).
