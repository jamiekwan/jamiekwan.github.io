					<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Let's go back to 2014, where I found a passion for using design to help people thrive.</h3>
					
					<p>Fresh out of design school, I landed a job that immersed my growth in the world of sustainability and inclusive design. I had the opportunity to facilitate youth-engagement workshops with the <a href="https://www.sustainable.to/east-scarborough-storefront/zn7776i2cl08rzh4qt2030769lxtua" target="_blank">East Scarborough Storefront</a>&mdash;an adaptive re-use community hub designed in part by the neighbourhood residents and kids. </p>
					
					<p>Seeing the impact of participation and empowerment cemented my foundational beliefs in the human-side of design and the design process.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-4 wow fadeInRight story-mid right-justified">
					<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">That's when I turned to designing for curiosity and joy, as I gained a growing interest in digital.</h3>

					<p>I thought to myself: regardless of if we design for the built world, or the digital world, ultimately we impact people&mdash;human-beings! I pursued a Masters in Digital Media, focusing my work on <a href="../creative-catalyst" target="_blank">interaction</a>, <a href="https://www.studiobud.ca/" target="_blank">Gen Z innovation</a>, and <a href="../sensing-history" target="_blank">sensory design</a>. There, I found a passion for storytelling, as a common human thread in design, before landing in the world of theme parks.</p>

					<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Theme Park Design&mdash;the dream job that taught me about heroes and play.</h3>
					
					<p >I credit theme parks as a pivotal turning point in my early career. It's something I never saw myself doing, or even pursued, but it became the best ice breaker EVER. Better yet, what I learned from entertainment design changed my viewpoint on design. <a>More here</a>.</p>

					<ol class="story-list">
						<li><b>Design IS play! </b>I learned that great design doesn't come from formula. The best comes from collaboratively thinking differently&mdash;and often, different comes from playfully exploring the unknown.</li>

						<li><b>We should design for heroes, not humans. </b>Long story short, theme parks are naturally an emotional roller coaster&mdash;and thus, human-centered. I learned that the best of these carefully map out how visitors transform throughout the journey, overcoming fear or being empowered with energy.</li>

						<li><b>The best of design invites play.</b> And by play, I mean participation.</li>
