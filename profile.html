						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Let's go back to 2014, where I found a passion for using design to help people thrive.</h3>
						
						<p>Fresh out of design school, I started my career immersing myself in sustainability and community design with a local boutique firm. I had the opportunity to facilitate youth-engagement workshops with the <a href="https://www.sustainable.to/east-scarborough-storefront/zn7776i2cl08rzh4qt2030769lxtua" target="_blank">East Scarborough Storefront</a>&mdash;an adaptive re-use community hub designed in part by the neighbourhood residents and kids. </p>
						
						<p>Seeing the impact of participation and empowerment cemented my foundational beliefs in in human-centered design.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-4 wow fadeInRight story-mid right-justified">
						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">That's when I turned to designing for curiosity and joy, as I gained a growing interest in digital.</h3>

						<p>With an interest in digital as a dynamic and transformative element of how we experienced cities and spaces, I pursued a Masters in Digital Media, focusing my work on <a href="../creative-catalyst" target="_blank">human-computer interaction</a>, <a href="https://www.studiobud.ca/" target="_blank">Gen Z engagement and innovation</a>, and <a href="../sensing-history" target="_blank">inter-sensory design</a>. In that year of research, I found a passion for storytelling, as a common human thread in design, before landing in the world of theme parks.</p>

						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Theme Parks taught me about the value of 'hero-centered design'.</h3>
						
						<p>Designing attractions and literal fantasy cities showed me how heroic transformations can happen when you empower your end-user in <a>play, curiosity, and discovery</a>&mdash;design elements I now think are vital in embedding in our everyday life. I spent three years immersed in this world, and continue to think with a <a href="http://www.medium.com/tsun-do-ku" target="_blank">hero-centered mindset.</a></p>
