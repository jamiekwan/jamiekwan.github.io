						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Let's go back to 2013, where I found a passion for using design to help people thrive.</h3>
						
						<p>Fresh out of school, I started my career immersing myself in community-focused design with a boutique agency. I had the opportunity to facilitate youth-engagement workshops with the <a href="https://www.sustainable.to/east-scarborough-storefront/zn7776i2cl08rzh4qt2030769lxtua" target="_blank">East Scarborough Storefront</a>&mdash;an adaptive re-use community hub designed in part by the neighbourhood residents and kids. </p>
						
						<p>Seeing the impact of participatory design cemented my foundational beliefs in human-centered design.</p>

				<div class="row" id="desktop-only">
					<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-4 wow fadeInRight story-mid right-justified">
						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">I found a joy for instiling elements of discovery in my work, and rewarding curiosity through design.</h3>

						<p>I love that digital has a unique ability to prompt diverse and dynamic experiences in our day-to-day lives, especially when integrated into the built world. I pursued a Masters in Digital Media, focusing my work on <a href="../creative-catalyst" target="_blank">human-computer interaction</a>, <a href="https://www.studiobud.ca/" target="_blank">kid-centered design</a>, and <a href="../sensing-history" target="_blank">multisensory experiences</a>. I started to use a lens of storytelling&mdash;studying how narratives can impact the process and products of design as a universal language. Naturally, this landed me into the world of theme parks.</p>

					<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-1 wow fadeInLeft story-mid" data-wow-delay="0.5s">
						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Theme Park Design taught me about the value of 'hero-centered design'.</h3>
						
						<p>Designing attractions (and literal fantasy worlds) showed me how heroic transformations can happen when you empower your end-user in <a>play and imagination</a>&mdash;design elements I think are highly transferrable to our everyday life. I continue to think with a <a href="https://medium.com/tsun-do-ku/hero-centered-design-ef08ed407fc1" target="_blank">hero-centered mindset</a>, applying an experience-first mindset in the spaces we surround ourselves everyday: the workplace. I believe that our day-to-day lives can be, and should be, heroically meaningful&mdash;and that starts with the process of design.</p>

						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Today, I act as a connector of playful, creative creatures. I love to elevate wonderful weirdoes.</h3>

						<p>I believe that the design process can be made accessible, fun, and empowering for all; and that it can be even more diverse than it currently is. I've found a true skill in connecting people who were seldom to cross paths, to solve wicked problems together. I see design internally and externally&mdash;working with the belief that our team and workplace cultures have a direct impact on the solutions we put out into the world. With that in mind, I love to build opportunities for ideas and action to take flight, spending 90% of my time creating the conditions for creativity to thrive. And right now, I'm lucky to be doing that at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise" target="_blank">Atlassian</a>.</p>

						    <p><b>I help organizations work through big ideas and sticky problems</b> by building a deep understanding of the system at play through the use of primary and secondary research. I design effective (and fun!) engagements to connect brands with their people and audience in a meaningful and enjoyable way, and discover what makes their heart tick. I lead end-user engagement and participatory design processes that have included everyone from middle-schoolers all the way up to senior leaders.</p>
