	<h4><strong>I'm currently a Designer in the Creative Studio at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forrec.com">FORREC Ltd</a>.</strong></h4>

	<p>I research, ideate, design, and create storytelling interventions that aim to send people on adventures between the physical and digital world, and foster meaningful human connections. I create experiences that ignite play <img src="assets/images/emoji/play.png" align="middle" width=20px hspace=2px> , curiosity <img src="assets/images/emoji/curiosity.png" align="middle" width=20px hspace=2px> , and happiness <img src="assets/images/emoji/happiness.png" align="middle" width=20px hspace=2px>. At FORREC, my work currently has a focus on theme parks, museums, and other entertainment-related spaces.</p>

    		<p><strong>Here are a few things I believe in:</strong></p>
    		<div class="text-muted">
        		<ul>
        			<li><mark>Design.</mark><br> As someone with a foot both in Architecture (physical) and Digital Media (virtual), I'm a big believer that design is about human experiences: about holistically thinking and reshaping the way people experience the world. As a designer, my work always starts with the 'why', and that vision informs everything from the scale of a building and down to the pixel.</li>
        			<br>
        			<li><mark>Urbanism.</mark><br> I'm always thnking about cities and urban spaces. I"m passionate for the community I live in, and how people connect with each other and their homes. My work beyond my 9-5 career is geared at building connections between communities, engaging the public in creative, collaborative play that ignites a sense of wonder, curiosity, and inspiration.</li>
        			<br>
        			<li><marK>Storytelling.</marK><br> Technology evolves very quickly: buildings become increasingly complex through digital fabrication, and digital technologies become increasingly autonomous, ubiquitous, and responsive. But as long as your storytelling and emotional depth are intact, <i>that's</i> where people will connect with an experience.</li>
