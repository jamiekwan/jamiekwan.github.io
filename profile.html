						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Let's go back to 2014, where I found a passion for using design to help people thrive.</h3>
						
						<p>Fresh out of school, I started my career immersing myself in community-focused design with a boutique agency. I had the opportunity to facilitate youth-engagement workshops with the <a href="https://www.sustainable.to/east-scarborough-storefront/zn7776i2cl08rzh4qt2030769lxtua" target="_blank">East Scarborough Storefront</a>&mdash;an adaptive re-use community hub designed in part by the neighbourhood residents and kids. </p>
						
						<p>Seeing the impact of participatory design cemented my foundational beliefs in human-centered design.</p>

						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">I let curiosity lead my growth, and found a love for instiling elements of discovery into my design work.</h3>

						<p>Digital has the ability to create so many diverse, dynamic, and personal experiences, when integrated into the built world. I pursued a Masters in Digital Media, focusing my work on <a href="../creative-catalyst" target="_blank">human-computer interaction</a>, <a href="https://www.studiobud.ca/" target="_blank">Gen Z innovation</a>, and <a href="../sensing-history" target="_blank">multisensory experiences</a>. In that year, I looked at how archetypal narrative structure can be applied to the interactions we have with the world. I found a passion for storytelling, as a common human thread in both digital and physical design, before landing in the world of theme parks.</p>

						<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Designing for Theme Parks taught me about the value of 'hero-centered design'.</h3>
						
						<p>Designing attractions (and literal fantasy worlds) showed me how heroic transformations can happen when you empower your end-user in <a>play, storytelling, and imagination</a>&mdash;design elements I think are highly transferrable to our everyday life. Today, I continue to think with a <a href="https://medium.com/tsun-do-ku/hero-centered-design-ef08ed407fc1" target="_blank">hero-centered mindset</a>, in my current role at <a href="https://gensler.com" target="_blank">Gensler</a>.</p>
