					<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Let's go back to 2014, where I found a passion for using design to help people thrive.</h3>
					
					<p>Fresh out of design school, I started my career immersing myself in sustainability and community design with a local boutique firm. I had the opportunity to facilitate youth-engagement workshops with the <a href="https://www.sustainable.to/east-scarborough-storefront/zn7776i2cl08rzh4qt2030769lxtua" target="_blank">East Scarborough Storefront</a>&mdash;an adaptive re-use community hub designed in part by the neighbourhood residents and kids. </p>
					
					<p>Seeing the impact of participation and empowerment cemented my foundational beliefs in in human-centered design.</p>

					<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">That's when I turned to designing for curiosity and joy, as I gained a growing interest in digital.</h3>

					<p>With an interest in digital as a dynamic and transformative element of how we experienced cities and spaces, I pursued a Masters in Digital Media, focusing my work on <a href="../creative-catalyst" target="_blank">human-computer interaction</a>, <a href="https://www.studiobud.ca/" target="_blank">Gen Z engagement and innovation</a>, and <a href="../sensing-history" target="_blank">inter-sensory design</a>. In that year of research, I found a passion for storytelling, as a common human thread in design, before landing in the world of theme parks.</p>

					<h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Theme Parks taught me about the value of hero-centered design.</h3>
					
					<p>Designing destination attractions and literal fantasy cities showed me how transformation can happen when you empower your end user in play, curiosity, and discovery&mdash;design elements I think are vital in embedding our everyday life.</p>

					<ol class="story-list">
						<li><b>Design IS play! </b>I learned that great design doesn't come from formula. The best comes from collaboratively thinking differently&mdash;and often, different comes from playfully exploring the unknown.</li>

						<li><b>We should design for heroes, not humans. </b>Long story short, theme parks are naturally an emotional roller coaster&mdash;and thus, human-centered. I learned that the best of these carefully map out how visitors transform throughout the journey, overcoming fear or being empowered with energy.</li>

						<li><b>The best of design invites play.</b> And by play, I mean participation.</li>
