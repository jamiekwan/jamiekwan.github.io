    body-heading: "Thinking Out Loud"
    body-text: "Sketching has always been a major part of my thought process, and as an Experience Designer, allows me to imagine myself in the end user's point-of-view &mdash; putting this view on paper is integral to communicating design intent and strategy. This is a look inside my sketchbook."
    quote: "Architecture cannot divorce itself from drawing, no matter how impressive the technology gets. Drawings are not just end products&colon; they are part of the thought process of architectural design. Drawings express the interaction of our minds, eyes and hands."
