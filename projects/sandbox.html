The Augmented Reality (AR) Sandbox was originally conceived by Hiroshii Ishii out of the MIT Media Lab in 2002, and then made open-sourced by <a href="http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/" target="_blank">Oliver Kreylos' lab</a> at UC Davis. Real-time topography is generated from the sand's surface, and projected directly onto the white children's sand â€” becoming a live, three-dimensional topographic map. We built this tabletop interface with the open-sourced data and software, as a pre-curser to adapting the system to applications in transmedia storytelling, tangible gaming, and visualizing urban community development potential. Referenced as part of my Masters research project, it was built as a means of observing embodied interactions within a STEM learning context, in an effort to understand how to similarly design for a cultural history application.

This demo is on-display in the Ryerson University Digital Media Experience Lab in addition to off-site locations such as the Royal Ontario Museum and TIFF digiPlaySpace. We hoped to build the foundations for future graduate students to pursue research and development using the Sandbox as a platform in the MDM program.
