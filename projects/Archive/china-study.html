  			<p>Along with 15 other students, the 2-month trip took me through Eastern and Northern China, starting in Beijing - the People's Capital - and ending in the metropolis of Shanghai. Areas covered included the rural Shanxi province, visiting the Yungang Grottoes and Ancient Capital of Xi'an, as well as the Hubei province, staying at the China Three Gorges University and touring the Yangtze River and Shennongjia Mountain region.</p>
  			<p>Sketching was used as a main method for exploring the culture and architecture of traditional and modern Chinese sites, practicing sketching as a method of note-taking and analysis. </p>
