<p>If you know my brother,<a href="http://www.danielhkwan.com" target="_blank"> Daniel Kwan</a>, you'll know that he holds a wealth of random knowledge: ranging from gaming, to lore, to science, to archaeology, to all things pizza. If you ever meet him, ask him for a fun fact. I dare you.</p>

<p>Based in Toronto, Curiosity in Focus emerged as a way to capture the conversations Daniel has when learning about and from really interesting people. Short and simply, it's a record of conversations that Daniel finds really freaking cool. </p>

<p>The branding is simple, bold, and interactive, allowing him to easily use the various forms and layouts in multiple contexts, both online and offline; quite simply empowering play as he grows as a creator. It reflects the authenticity, spontaneity and storytelling that Daniel has already built, elevating the personal brand to a new visual identity. The design is intended to meld into the overall social media strategy that Daniel already has in storytelling features of various individuals. The graphic and icon help in refining the visual identity of those stories within his existing feed.</p>

<p>On an ongoing basis, my role as Creative Director for <a href="http://www.curiosityinfocus.com" target="_blank">Curiosity in Focus</a> serves in shaping the high-level experience and creative assets of the brand across the various channels.</p>
