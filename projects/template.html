<h4 class="subheading">Concept: Suspend visitors into the night sky as a retreat from a crowded, fast-paced all night art festival.</h4>
<hr class="xs-thick-hr" align="left">

In the midst of the night, this piece created a serene retreat within a crowded and fast-paced nighttime event. This interactive, audio-visual art installation was exhibited as part of Scotiabank’s Nuit Blanche 2013, Toronto’s largest all-night public art festival. The room - approximately 20x20 feet in size - was filled with over 150 spherical lights, using mirrored walls to create an infinite, immersive, and ephemeral spatial experience. With a visual trompe-l'oeil, tactile interaction with select lights generates musical feedback and lighting changes to create an atmosphere akin to a dynamic night sky.
