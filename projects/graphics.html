			<h4>Experimenting with Motion Graphics &amp; Generative Media</h4>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>As many Creatives out there, I try to fill my spare time with as much learning as possible. In fact, I've gained quite the reputation in saying 'yes' to way too many side projects â€“ mainly because I just love to work with my friends on any creative endeavour! </p>
			<p>However, I use these collaborative, personal projects as opportunities to learn new skills. Motion Graphics, created mainly for use in video and social media, allowed me to familiarize myself with Adobe AfterEffects. Next up: creating dynamic and interactive graphics using the Processing language. Stay tuned!</p>
