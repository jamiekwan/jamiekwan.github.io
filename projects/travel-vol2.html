<div class="col-md-8">
	<p>This land trip took me through Eastern and Northern China, starting in Beijing - the People's Capital - and ending in the metropolis of Shanghai. Areas covered included the rural Shanxi province, visiting the Yungang Grottoes and Ancient Capital of Xi'an, as well as the Hubei province, staying at and collaborating with the China Three Gorges University on a masterplanning exercise, and touring the Yangtze River and Shennongjia Mountain region.</p>
