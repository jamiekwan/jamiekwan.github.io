concept: "Design-Build of five wild bee habitats in key locations in the GTA, to generate conversation on DIY efforts in saving the bees."
---

Rapidly facing population decline, the bee hotels strengthen the urban ecology by providing nesting spaces for solitary bees. The structures are built entirely from recycled urban material, while creating a site-specific aesthetic for an educational initiative centered on pollinator health. We wanted to show that bee habitats can be beautiful and easy to build in your own backyard!

This project has continued as an ongoing national initiative in association with Fairmont Hotel and Resorts, Pollinator Partnership Canada, and Burt's Bees. The structures were built in collaboration with youth from at-risk neighbourhoods, and travelled to local farmer's markets and neighbourhood events as part of the educational campaign.
