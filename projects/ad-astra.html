challenge: "Design a large-scale art installation for Toronto's busiest all-night street festival. Turn a 400 sqft lunchroom at the Bata Shoe Museum into a festival destination."

solution: "Ad Astra was an interactive experience that immersed visitors into an infinite night sky and created a quiet — but memorable — retreat from a festival known for crowds and late-night antics across the City of Toronto. One of the core goals of the project was to create a simple, photogenic intervention that the general public could relate to, and become an active participant in the experience."

In the midst of the night, this piece created a serene retreat within a crowded and fast-paced nighttime event. This interactive, audio-visual art installation was exhibited as part of Scotiabank’s Nuit Blanche 2013, Toronto’s largest all-night public art festival. The room - approximately 20x20 feet in size - was filled with over 150 spherical lights, using mirrored walls to create an infinite, immersive, and ephemeral spatial experience. With a visual trompe-l'oeil, tactile interaction with select lights generates musical feedback and lighting changes to create an atmosphere akin to a dynamic night sky.

This piece was a collaboration between 7 architecture grads, a biomedical engineer, a musician, and a sound engineer, and completed as part of ReduxLab at Ryerson University.
