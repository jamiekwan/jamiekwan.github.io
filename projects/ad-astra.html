challenge: "Design a large-scale art installation for Toronto's busiest all-night street festival. Turn a 400 sqft lunchroom at the Bata Shoe Museum into a festival destination."

solution: "Ad Astra was an interactive experience that immersed visitors into an infinite night sky and created a quiet — but memorable — retreat from a festival known for crowds and late-night antics across the City of Toronto. One of the core goals of the project was to create a simple, photogenic intervention that the general public could relate to, and become an active participant in the experience."

<p>The room – approximately 20x20 feet in size – was filled with over 150 spherical lights, and clad from floor-to-ceiling in mirrored acrylic panels to create an infinite night sky.</p>

<p>Visitors were invited to enter into the space — eight at a time – to explore. Open-ended interactions encouraged exploration, and upon discovery of "trigger" lights, the overall space responded with location-specific music and lighting changes in sync to the audio. <strong>Beyond the visual experience, Ad Astra turned small visitor interactions into large spatial responses.</strong></p>

"Once inside the dreamlike (or was I just dreaming?) space, there was a sense of peacefulness amongst those enjoying the aesthetically pleasing, almost otherworldly void we found ourselves a part of."

<p>This installation was a collaboration between 7 architecture grads, a biomedical engineer, a musician, and a sound engineer, and completed as part of ReduxLab at Ryerson University. The installation was exhibited as part of Scotiabank’s Nuit Blanche 2013, Toronto’s largest all-night public art festival, and named amongst the 'Must-See Independent Exhibits' by Designlines Magazine. </p>
