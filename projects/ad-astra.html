    <p>Ad Astra was an interactive experience that immersed visitors into an infinite night sky and created a quiet — but highly memorable — retreat from a festival known for crowds and all-night adventures across the city. <span class="theme-color"><strong>BOne of the core goals of the project was to create a simple, photogenic intervention that the general public could immerse themselves within, and as well, become an active participant in a collective experience.</strong></span></p>

    <p>The room – approximately 20x20 feet in size – was filled with over 150 spherical lights, and clad from floor-to-ceiling in mirrored acrylic panels to create the impression of an infinite night sky. Visitors were invited to enter into the space — eight at a time – to explore. Open-ended interactions encouraged exploration, and upon discovery of "trigger" lights, the overall space responded with location-specific music and lighting changes in sync to the audio. <span class="theme-color"><strong>Beyond the visual experience, Ad Astra turned small visitor interactions into large spatial responses.</strong></span></p>

    <p>The installation was exhibited at the Bata Shoe Museum, as part of Scotiabank’s Nuit Blanche 2013 - Toronto’s largest all-night public art festival - and named amongst the top 'Must-See Independent Exhibits' by Designlines Magazine.</p>
