We believe that the best ideas come from thinking freely. That's why we bet on young minds. Studio Bud is a creative initiative aimed at bridging youth to the process of solving problems and challenges faced in the community. Co-founded as part of the <a href="http://www.ryerson.ca/graduate/digitalmedia"> Master of Digital Media </a>program at Ryerson, we run rapid design sprint workshops about anything and everything, but with one commonality: we want to unlock the creative potential of GenZ youth in driving innovation through the power of play and design thinking.

We lead collaborative workshops with our partners, putting youth in direct creative contact with non-profit and for-profit organizations. Unconstrained by the technical worries, youth collaborate to find inspiration, discover solutions, iterate quickly, and implement prototypes. They gain valuable skills through experiential learning, while partners gain insight and find inspiration through blue-sky ideation.

Past partners have included Canon Canada, Community Innovation Lab / NEET Youth Incubator, Harbord Collegiate Institute, the Supa Maasai Foundation, and Heroes in Black. More info can be found at <a href="http://www.studiobud.ca" target="_blank">www.studiobud.ca</a>
