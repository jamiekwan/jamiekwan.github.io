The park building is an object within a landscape. The Grenadier Pavilion catalyses activity and engagement with nature, as well as parts of the park not normally accessible. Located in an area of High Park completely overtaken by nature, the semi-permeable pavilion generates new contemplative and functional experiences of the park through a redefinition of the park shelter typology, both inside and out. This provides new access to the water, and creates new perspectives of the park. The simplicity of the program is extended into the detailing and construction - a gesture appropriate for the surrounding park context.
