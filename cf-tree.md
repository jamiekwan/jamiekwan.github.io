oneliner: "How might we unveil Canada's Tallest Christmas Tree with the energy of the community?"

client: "Cadillac Fairview"
date: "July - August 2018"

brief: "In anticipation of the 2018 annual unveiling of Cadillac Fairviewâ€™s holiday decor, Gensler was engaged to identify the opportunities in their existing line-up to create new experiences and drive post-event retail sales."
process: "We worked closely alongside their internal marketing and retained agency to benchmark against other holiday events of scale, identifying core guiding principles and goals for the experience. Three scalable concepts resulted based on these initial conversations."
results: "Early planning concepts were refined, alongside technology and service implications, resulting in the piloting of a wearable RFID wristband experience, distributed in the week prior to unveiling and becoming a means of participation for the audience. The distribution of LED wristbands were aligned with social good initiatives and retail partnerships."
