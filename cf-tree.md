title: CF Holiday Experience Strategy
oneliner: "How might we unveil Canada's Tallest Christmas Tree with the energy of the community?"

client: "Cadillac Fairview"
date: "July - August 2018"

brief: "In anticipation of the 2018 annual unveiling of Cadillac Fairviewâ€™s holiday decor, Gensler was engaged to identify the opportunities in their existing line-up to create new experiences and drive post-event retail sales."
process: "We worked closely alongside their internal marketing and retained agency to benchmark against other holiday events of scale, identifying core guiding principles and goals for the experience. Three scalable concepts resulted based on these initial conversations."
results: "Early planning concepts were refined, alongside technology and service implications, resulting in the piloting of a wearable RFID wristband experience, distributed in the week prior to unveiling and becoming a means of participation for the audience. The distribution of LED wristbands were aligned with social good initiatives and retail partnerships."

    body-heading: The Hero's Journey
    body-text: "Through focus groups with their Storytellers (Employees), Film Seekers (Customers), and Film Lovers (Members), we collaboratively mapped out the various moments and touchpoints and Hero (visitor) would have engaging with TIFF's platform and entering the space. While we were scoped to look at the temporary traveling exhibit space, we considered the space in the context of their overall business model and program offerings to determine how one experience leads into another, and ultimately builds on a transformational experience for our 'Hero'. The outcome of this journey mapping exercise started to establish where WOW moments would occur, and where crush space may be needed to decompress from the visitor experience for reflection."
