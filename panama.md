title: Experience Canalside - Panama Canal Tourism Plan
oneliner: "How might we enhance a wonder of the built world through storytelling: transforming Tourists into Explorers?"

brief: "What is the tourism potential of the Panama Canal? Working directly with the Panama Canal Authority, we were asked to identify key locations along the entirety of their property (stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean!) and how they might be leveraged into competitive and targeted destination attractions."

process: "Benchmarking, on-site research, and pulse and stakeholder interviews were conducted over the course of one month to develop their tourism personas and their stories. These personas were used to imagine the potential of five areas based on their location and adjacencies. Concept master plans and brand identities were created to drive early conversations for development."

results: "A concept book was created to carry the project forward into development, outlining the concept master plans and research process. The personas were used throughout the entirety of the project, and remain a key tool in the client’s tourism development, as a means of maintaining a human-centered design mindset—a challenge when operating at the scale of the Panama Canal!"
