title: Experience Canalside - Panama Canal Tourism Plan
oneliner: "How might we enhance a wonder of the built world through storytelling: transforming Tourists into Explorers?"

client: "Panama Canal Authority"
date: "2017-2018"

brief: "What is the tourism potential of the Panama Canal? Working directly with the Panama Canal Authority, we were asked to identify key locations along the entirety of their property (stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean!) and how they might be leveraged into competitive and targeted destination attractions."

process: "Benchmarking, on-site research, and pulse and stakeholder interviews were conducted over the course of one month to develop their tourism personas and their stories. These personas were used to imagine the potential of five areas based on their location and adjacencies. Concept master plans and brand identities were created to drive early conversations for development."

results: "A concept book was created to carry the project forward into development, outlining the concept master plans and research process. The personas were used throughout the entirety of the project, and remain a key tool in the client’s tourism development, as a means of maintaining a human-centered design mindset—a challenge when operating at the scale of the Panama Canal!"

    body-heading: Research & Discovery
    body-text: "Spending a week in a Panama Canal visitor's shoes was not like what I expected. Our team hopped into a car to explore their on-land engineering facilities, before taking a speedboat ride from one end of the canal to another, visiting eco-tourism sites that local schools would visit. Along the way, we spoke with locals and employees at the Panama Canal. <br><br>Out of this research, we benchmarked and identified their key personas&mdash;their Tourism Explorers&mdash;that set the tone for the architectural and landscape development planning. These personas not only allowed the design teams to better understand their end-user, but also became a vehicle of communication for our client team, using the names to better allow them to participate in the design process and see their decisions and feedback from the perspective from their Explorers."

    body-text: "We translated research, local and regional anecdotes, and futures thinking into five unique tourism offerings across the country for their 800,000+ annual tourists. The intent? Creating architecture and icons that the became the brand in itself for the whole world to see and pass through."
