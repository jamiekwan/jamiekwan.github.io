<p>In 2017, I had the opportunity to lead and support the development of a tourism plan for the Panama Canal, taking on the challenge of immersing into the existing experience in Panama City and understanding what motivations and expectations their 800,000 tourists might have currently and in the future. The result? Five unique tourism offerings across the country, and creating an architectural icon that becomes a brand in itself, for the whole world to see.</p>
