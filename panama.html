	<p>We partnered with Cineplex Entertainment to collaborate with Gen Z youth on imagining the future of entertainment, with the movie theatre as the launching point. <strong>The result? It had nothing to do with movies.</strong> They care about entertainment offerings that are relevant to their day-to-day social lives, go beyond what they can get on Netflix, and that will be a home away from home&mdash;all anchored around scalability, exclusivity, and shareability.</p>
