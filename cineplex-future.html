    title: Cineplex Workshop 1: Future of Entertainment
    body-heading: "Workshop 1: Reinventing the Theatre"
    body-text: "<p>What happens when you put 40 young and creative teenagers into a movie theatre for 6 hours, loaded with popcorn and pizza, and all the design tools and mentorship they could ask for? Their mission: to create the ultimate in-theatre experience of the future. </p><p>We worked closely with Cineplex's Research & Marketing teams to understand their Gen Z audience, and engaged a local high school to align research endeavours with educational opportunities in the real world. The workshop was designed to ignite blue-sky thinking&mdash;allowing the kids to imagine to the ends of their creativity without constraints. Five unique ideas were generated by the end of the workshop, after which the Studio Bud team worked with Cineplex to extract key insights that informed each idea.</p>"
    quote: "Talking about what teens might want is one thing. Watching them design their own experiences and talking to them directly about it is a whole other level of depth and insight. Extremely valuable exercise."

	<p>We partnered with Cineplex Entertainment to collaborate with Gen Z youth on imagining the future of entertainment, with the movie theatre as the launching point. The result? It had nothing to do with movies.</p>
