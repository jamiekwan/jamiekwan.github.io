In 1991, Mark Weiser – the ‘father of ubiquitous computing’ – described a world where digital technology disappeared: where computers weaved into the fabric of everyday life until they became physically and mentally indistinguishable [1]. It was also in 1991 that I was born; and 25 years later (as a Millennial, semi-‘digital native’ just starting a career in the architecture industry), I find it intriguing to think about how digital media and technology are beginning to meld within every aspect of an everyday urban experience. But how does this impact architecture?

Personal computers and smartphones became household objects in the latter half of my life, and my generation was in a unique position to truly see how digital technology shifted how we live, work, and play. Facebook became hugely popular just after I started high school, effectively creating the space for cyber teenage drama, resulting in the awkward social engagements predisposed by social media. iPhones, Blackberries, and other smartphones – along with an immediate access to information – became common sight as I entered into architecture school and shifted how we learn in a 21st century. It also meant that we’re never bored commuting to work or school with games, reading, and news accessible with simply your fingerprint and a few taps on a screen. It now feels completely unnatural to be separated from those mini supercomputers in your pocket, and going about daily life as a luddite to purge digital technology is next to impossible. Trust me – 48 hours without anything digital is a nightmare for trying to lead a normal social life amongst equally connected people. 

We engage with digital media and technology almost instinctively through everyday life, and these actions are inherently existing within or impact how we experience physical spaces. Some events in public spaces now happen only because of the possibilities of mass-organizing through digital media – a gathering to watch a sports game, gatherings for noteworthy global events, or even stranger social gatherings like large-scale pillow fights and slip and slides through the streets of downtown. 

The ubiquity that Weiser referred to in 1991 is almost a reality today, but architectural space has yet to truly respond to these new social processes through form, function and experience. 

More and more as mobile technology evolves, digital media is appropriated and operating within the context of collective physical spaces. Aside from the obvious Augmented Reality technologies literally overlaying digital media onto the physical world, all digital experiences exist within the context of a place. An event happening in an urban public space extends into a virtual social network as people share media instantaneously on Facebook Live, Snapchat, and Instagram, multiplexing onto a digital ‘bulletin’. Even a mobile game on your smartphone becomes a shared experience as you playfully compete with your friends, whether physically apart or sitting adjacent to one another.

Virtual experiences inherently extend into and operate in the context of physical space, whether through the multiplexing of shared media from live events onto a virtual feed, or connecting on a solo mobile device within a collective environment.

Crowdsourced playfulness in unconventional locations bring people together through gaming and entertainment. The Happy Hockey interactive game recently exhibited at TIFF Bell Lightbox allowed any visitor with a smartphone device to tap into a massive multiplayer hockey game projected onto the double-height atrium wall. Movie theatres are also catching on, with wifi-based pre-movie interactive entertainment involving trivia and games against your fellow audience members. However, the difference remains between these two examples: what type of architectural form supports crowdsourced, and sometimes spontaneous, play?

Separate from devices, media walls and projections are also becoming increasingly interactive as full-body experiences, whether a collaborative or solo interaction. You can find many of these examples installed in exhibitions for museums, pop-up shops for branded marketing, window displays on urban sidewalks, or in public spaces as new media art. Motion sensing input devices, such as the XBox Kinect, make full-body gestural interactives possible without defaulting to using a smartphone device as a lens into virtual space.

Digital technology also has a powerful connection to data and communication channels. Beacon technology and wearable devices have recently shown the potentials for location-based communication between people and places. The newly released Pokemon Go mobile game, by Nintendo, pairs with a separate but connected wearable wristband, augmented the Pokemon universe overtop of the city and buzzing when you’re physically close to a digital interaction. Outside of gaming, beacon technology has been popular with retailers, pushing coupons and messages to your smartphone device welcoming you into stores as you pass by. Marketing departments love this, but think about the experiential possibilities: parks or urban treks that encourage exploration and discovery to bring you into new types of spaces; urban streetscapes that present serendipitous encounters, perhaps even paired with personal social media data. 

Yes, my examples thus far are mostly social networks, interactive games and new media art. But what I find most interesting is that these digital experiences draw from architectural metaphors that serve as the structure to a consciously-designed virtual space. From the Facebook ‘wall’ and ‘communities’ of content creators, to digital media that exists on architectural components or requires a full-body interaction to engage with content: digital media takes cues from the real world to generate experiences in which people find meaning and value. But what about the reverse? What opportunities exist if we turn that thought around: instead of thinking about digital media within the context of architecture, what happens when architecture is designed experientially in the context of new media and digital technology?

Imagine if we saw architectural design at the very onset as co-designed, holistic experiences. Public spaces designed both physically and digitally to support social play using large-scale media. Schools designed that consider evolving teaching practices and curriculum in a digital age; designed to work with the mindset of youth studying with smartphones and amongst social networks, games, and media. What about community architecture that truly works with social networks in bringing a neighbourhood closer together and creating a greater sense of place? Informal gathering spaces that take Snapchat’s defining spontaneous features into consideration, towards a more social in-person and joyful public experience. Retail centers that integrate online shopping experiences into a social shopping experience in-stores, pushing information to your devices as you walk by to instil a sense of exploration. 

In my mind, the consideration of digital technology in the design of architectural spaces exists in every building typology. In a short 25 years, it’s no doubt that digital media is encroaching onto the experience of physical spaces – and that doesn’t have to be a negative thought. I don’t have the silver bullet to offer, but I do know that thinking holistically about an architectural experience, down to the pixel scale, allows creative professionals to begin to create truly meaningful spaces for people living in the digital age. If both virtual and physical form follows the narrative of a designed experience, scaled to every detail possible, then perhaps Weiser’s vision for ubiquity could finally be achieved within the urban landscape.
