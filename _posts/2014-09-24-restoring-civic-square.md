When Toronto's new City Hall opened in 1965, it became a place where Torontonians congregated, socialized, protested, and in general, exercised their civil character. It was a place where democracy was truly represented, and brings to mind the social life of the Ancient Greek Agora - where democracy was first brought to life. The architect, Viljo Revell, even designed the new City Hall to formally represent democracy: two towers cradling the council chamber, brought to the exterior of the building, extending into Nathan Phillips Square in full public access. 

Just as William Whyte discovered in New York City, in his 1980 study entitled The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, people use these urban public spaces between buildings in very interesting ways - even if it's simply open space, steps, planters, and/or ledges. People adapt their needs to the geometry of the space, sitting on steps designed for walking; planters designed for plants; ledges surrounding water features become seating on a hot summer day; moving chairs slightly to face the other end of their discussions, to gain control and comfort over the space. Even open spaces contain a ballet of movement, a well orchestrated gathering of people interacting face to face. 

But when you bring the City Hall and Nathan Phillips Square into today's age, the social life of the civic square has adapted to the rise of technology. Yes, there are groups who eat lunch together in the square; yes, there are protests and events that happen that make this a social space; yes people do still use steps, planters, and ledges as seating; and yes, programmed events insert life into urban spaces. But a new demographic has been added to the mix: the mobile user. Look at a busy public space in Downtown Toronto, and there's bound to be at least a group of people alone, going about their own business, but internalized into their mobile devices. I'm not going to say that we've become non-social as a whole, but in many ways, the life of face-to-face communication has diminished substantially, and the way interaction and communication occurs on a daily basis in the public realm has changed. 

Are these new types of people a non-social group invading the social civic square? 

I argue, no. They're merely communicating in a very different way within a physically social environment. While they may appear to be isolating themselves within a social space, they are actually connecting to others via a digital realm - connecting in many ways far greater than face-to-face. And this constant connection on a global scale has both positive and negative implications.

1. What is happening to the life of face-to-face communication? The materiality of everyday life?
2. How do we enable the benefits of this global digital connection to face-to-face communication? Should we?
3. How can the physical landscape of the city shape to the behaviour of these new types of mobile users, and what change does this make on urban design?

But a main question does come to mind when applied to Toronto City Hall: how can we restore civic qualities of civic spaces? Further, how can we crowdsource city building, and enable residents to shape their own neighbourhood? Where do these collective actions take place?

There are many examples online where people go to make civic change. Social Media has allowed citizens to interact with politics and the city itself. Crowdfunding sites create opportunities for civic change to happen locally (100in1Day, Kickstarter, Indiegogo). And Crowdsourcing sites that specifically drive ideation in the civic realm have just started to emerge in partnership with cities (for example, Change By Us NYC, partnered with PlaNYC - pictured above).

I think a great jumping off point for an idea would be to explore how these resources can be embedded within the civic square. How do you "restore" the civic qualities of a civic square to be inclusive to mobile users, while maintaining the face-to-face social life of the urban environment?
