This summer, I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to have my perspective published for the architectural profession. This was huge for me, as I was able to really show that everything I've done thus far in my career has been to think differently about the industries I operate within. 

A year after graduating from Architecture school, I decided to pursue a Masters degree in Digital Media: which had a focus on entrepreneurship, interaction design, and researching emerging digital technologies. 

Most people I talk to assumed that I left Architecture to apply my skills in a new discipline. While, yes, I wanted to experience a new discipline, it was only out of the interest in gaining new perspectives on Architecture, and gaining the skills to bridge the gap between physical and digital design. In my Perspectives article, I talk about ubiquitous computing and the process of designing architecture that scales down to the pixel detail, in the context of entertainment, gaming, and social media.

In 1991, Mark Weiser, the “father of ubiquitous computing,” described a world where digital technology disappeared, where computers were woven into the fabric of everyday life until they became physically and mentally indistinguishable1 It was also in 1991 that I was born; and 25 years later (as a Millennial, semi-“digital native” just starting a career in the architecture industry), I find it intriguing that digital media and technology are beginning to meld with every aspect of our urban experience. But how does this impact architecture?

Personal computers and smartphones became household objects in the latter half of my life, and my generation was in a unique position to truly see how digital technology shifted the way we live, work and play. Facebook became hugely popular just after I started high school, effectively creating the space for cyber-teenage-drama, resulting in those awkward social engagements facilitated by social media.

As I entered architecture school, Blackberries, iPhones and other smartphones were becoming a common sight, and completely shifting the 21st-century learning experience. Smartphones also meant that we were never bored commuting to work or school, with games, reading, and news accessible literally at our fingertips—with a simple fingerprint and a few taps on a screen. It now feels completely unnatural to be separated from those mini-supercomputers in our pockets, and going about daily life as a luddite, attempting to purge digital technology, is next to impossible. Trust me—trying to lead a normal life, without anything digital, amongst equally connected people, even for 48 hours, is a nightmare. 

We engage with digital media and technology almost instinctively, every day, and these actions exist within—and impact—how we experience physical spaces. Some events in public spaces happen only because of the mass-organization through digital media: gathering to watch in important game, to celebrate a special event, to observe a global event or, even stranger, to participate in a large-scale pillow fight or slip-and-slide through the streets of downtown.

The ubiquity that Weiser referred to in 1991 is almost a reality today, but architectural space has yet to truly respond to these new social processes through form, function and experience.</h4>
<br>
More and more as mobile technology evolves, digital media is operating within, even appropriating collective physical spaces. Augmented Reality is an obvious example: technologies that overlay digital media onto the apparent physical world. But all digital experiences exist within the context of a place. An event happening in an urban public space extends into a virtual social network as people share media instantaneously on Facebook Live, Snapchat, and Instagram, multiplexing onto a digital “bulletin.” Even a mobile game on a smartphone becomes a shared experience as you playfully compete with your friends, whether you are physically apart or sitting right next to them.

Crowd-sourced playfulness can sometimes bring people together through gaming and entertainment in unconventional locations. The Happy Hockey interactive game, by artists Johannes Kristmann and Alexander Pieper, and recently exhibited at TIFF Bell Lightbox, allowed any visitor with a smartphone to tap into a massive multiplayer hockey game projected onto the double-height atrium wall. Movie theatres are also catching on, with wifi-based pre-movie interactive entertainment involving trivia and games among audience members. The question is: what type of architectural form supports crowd-sourced and sometimes spontaneous, play?

Even without hand-held devices, media walls and projections are becoming increasingly interactive as full-body experiences, whether as a collaborative or a solo interaction. You can find many of these examples installed in exhibitions for museums, pop-up shops for branded marketing, window displays on urban sidewalks and public spaces as new media art. Motion-sensing input devices, such as the XBox Kinect, make full-body gestural interactives possible without defaulting to using a smartphone, as your portal into virtual space.

Digital technology also has a powerful connection to data and communication channels. Beacon technology and wearable devices have recently shown the potential for location-based communication between people and places. Nintendo’s newly released Pokemon Go mobile game pairs with a separate but connected wearable wristband, overlaying the Pokemon universe on the city and buzzing when you’re physically close to a digital interaction. Outside of gaming, beacon technology has been popular with retailers, pushing coupons and messages to your smartphone device welcoming you into stores as you pass by. Marketing departments love this, but think about the experiential possibilities: parks or urban treks that encourage exploration and discovery to bring you into new types of spaces; urban streetscapes that present serendipitous encounters, perhaps even paired with personal social media data, for a sense of personalization within a collective urban space.

My examples thus far are mostly social networks, interactive games and new media art. But what I find most interesting is that these digital experiences draw from architectural metaphors that serve as the structure to a consciously designed virtual space. From the Facebook “wall” and “communities” of content creators, to digital media that exists in or on architectural components, or requires a full-body interaction to engage with content, digital media takes cues from the real world to generate experiences in which people find meaning and value. 

But what about the reverse? What opportunities exist if we turn that thought around: instead of thinking about digital media within the context of architecture, what happens when architecture is designed experientially in the context of new media and digital technology?
<br>
<h4 class="article-subheading">Imagine if we saw architectural design at the very outset as co-designed, holistic experiences. </h4>
<br>
Public spaces designed both physically and digitally to support social play using large-scale digital media; schools designed to consider evolving teaching practices and curriculum in a digital age, designed to work with the mindset of youth studying with smartphones and amongst social networks, games, and media. What about community architecture that truly works with social networks in bringing a neighbourhood closer together and creating a greater sense of place? Informal gathering spaces that take Snapchat’s defining spontaneous features into consideration, towards a more social in-person and joyful public experience. Retail centres that integrate online shopping experiences into a social shopping experience in-store, pushing information to your devices as you walk by to instil a sense of exploration.

In my mind, the consideration of digital technology in the design of architectural spaces exists in every building typology. In a short 25 years, it’s no doubt that digital media is encroaching onto the experience of physical spaces—and that doesn’t have to be a negative thought. I don’t have the silver bullet to offer, but I do know that thinking holistically about an architectural experience, down to the pixel scale, allows creative professionals to begin to create truly meaningful spaces for people living in the digital age. If both virtual and physical form follow the narrative of a designed experience, scaled to every detail possible, then perhaps Weiser’s vision for ubiquity could finally be achieved within the urban landscape.
