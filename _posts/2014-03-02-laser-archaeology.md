title: "Laser Archaeology Changing the World"

For the past 10-15 years, my house has had a subscription to National Geographic magazine. Some we got ourselves. Most we got as gifts. They've added up to quite a long period, but either way we love the photographs and articles they publish. We're nerds like that.

Anyways, I was reading the December 2013 issue and they had an article on the preservation of historical landmarks/treasures using 3D scanning (what they called "Laser Archaeology") and with Google's latest innovation with Project Tango, it made me think a little bit about how this will change the world. Here's why...

In the future, we will have a full 3D record of the occupied space of the planet.

I mean, it may take a while, but at some point in the future, if Tango is applied in millions of smartphones, along with professionals actively scanning specimens, artifacts, and spaces all around the world, the digital record of the entire PLANET will be available to our disposal. This can open so many opportunities in the way we interact with spaces - considering that 90% of our time is spent indoors. Accessing this data through applications can enhance the experience of landmarks, museums, and galleries, as well as how we physically interact with the spaces we live in. This technology will help us navigate our occupied spaces, opening up opportunities for improved life safety systems, security, and sustainable features. Cannot wait until this is explored further!
