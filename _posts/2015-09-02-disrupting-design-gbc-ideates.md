The <i>Ideation Bootcamp</i>, a 4-day intensive, hands-on workshop at George Brown College's School of Design, allowed students to learn about their own appraoch to the creative process by looking at idea divergence and convergence with the mentored leadership of 8 multi-disciplinary experts.

I was absolutely honoured to have been approached to work with the students as one of those eight mentors, delivering a lecture and workshop in September 2015 to students in the Graphic Design and Interaction Design programs.

The 2-hour workshop I designed was all about introducing unconventional digital tools and media in the hands and perspectives of the two design disciplines, and the approach taken in linking tradition with new ideas. I presented various projects that I find inspiring, and then facilitated a quick design charrette that looked at challenging their Graphic Design skills with rapid ideation around an unconventional space currently ripe for digital innovation. Taking a design-thinking approach, my workshop used divergent ideation to rapidly inspire disruptive ideas.
