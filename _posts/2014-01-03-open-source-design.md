title: "Open Source Design in Architecture"

So I've recently been doing a lot of research in the application of digital media in architectural design for my graduate school applications, and among several projects, I came across Paperhouses. And no - this isn't a post about using paper as a material for residential buildings - but rather the application of "open-source" technology in the realm of architecture. Paperhouse was created as a means of creating a free open-source platform for "world-class design", so that anyone around the world has access to a library of architectural plans, which would then be modified to match user-specific needs. While I think this idea of accessibility to design is great, the approach that Paperhouse (and several other projects) takes seems somewhat backwards...

Architecture is the most public of the arts.

Especially with the popularity of "star-chitects", there's been this mentality that architecture is only about how a building looks. Making a building a true "architectural experience", evoking emotion, character, etc. etc. While this is a PART of architecture, many miss the main idea that architecture is not just an art, but is also a science. Architecture in it's most fundamental state shapes every moment of our lives, and provides us with shelter, expends energy to keep us thermally comfortable, and has an enormous impact on the environment - unlike almost any other form of art. 

Since the beginning of human civilization, buildings (or shelters) have risen as a direct result of cultural or environmental forces. They are built specifically for where they are sited: an igloo cannot be built in the desert and expected to perform in the same manner. 

I know this is sounding like a really angry rant about the current state of architecture...

HOWEVER if there is any part of the future of our cities that should excite us, one that is going to embrace new technologies and make architecture of more (social and environmental) value, then buildings should directly be responding to the environments around them. They should be shaped by the way the people who are going to be using them, actually use them! By the exact climate conditions on which they will be facing. 

With Paperhouse, doesn't it seem kind of strange if you're gaining access to a "world-class" design, and COMPLETELY changing the aesthetic of the building by scaling it down, rearranging the window, changing the building height, width, depth, and material to a more local context? Just sayin'.... 

I truly do support this open-source nature of design, and think that the use of digital media can allow for an increased accessibility to a profession that is really limited to the designers themselves.

Is it really too crazy of an idea to allow the people who are using the building to help design the building? Would this not result in a building that they would actually value and use to its fullest, as they are the one's that designed it?
