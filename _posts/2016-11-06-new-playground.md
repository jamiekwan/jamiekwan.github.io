It's nearly there! I'm so excited to finally share something that has been on the drawing board for months now: my new website! I've completely overhauled my portfolio into a website hosted on Github Pages, and COMPLETELY coded by yours truly. Though to be quite honest I don't think it will ever be "complete" and will always be in a state of iteration – as it should be. But it's now serving the real purpose of being a digital playground for the work that I do.

My last website was hosted on Squarespace since 2013 – when I first finished my undergrad. I had it there for many reasons. The first being that Squarespace was an <i>awesome</i> first site to use and get my feet wet in building a website. Their templates are stunning, the backend easy to navigate and use, and it was the most efficient way to get something up and running in time for when I sent it out to prospective employers. 

In the process of making this, I learned a ton. The obvious being HTML/CSS/Javascript. I'm truly a person that learns by doing – so I took the courage of trying it out myself, reading a ton of articles, and experimenting with this site. Github offered an awesome place to do so because it was free of charge for an unlimited number of pages under one domain, and worked with existing open-sourced frameworks like Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap.

This new website gives me the freedom to explore more web-based explorations, and I'll be starting with learning more about generative art, Processing, and p5.js! If you're into my work, keep an eye out for new things coming onto this website, where I'll explore my ideas/thoughts/philosophy through writing, code, and design.
