A year after graduating from Architecture school, I decided to pursue a Masters degree in Digital Media -- which had a focus on entrepreneurship, interaction design, and researching emerging digital technologies. Most assumed I had "left" architecture; perhaps "leaving" architecture is part of it, but I pursued a different professional context because I wanted to learn how to think differently about both the physical and digital worlds. Here's an excerpt of my article, where I talk about ubiquitous computing and the process of designing architecture that scales down to the pixel detail, in the context of entertainment.

In 1991, Mark Weiser, the “father of ubiquitous computing,” described a world where digital technology disappeared, where computers were woven into the fabric of everyday life until they became physically and mentally indistinguishable1 It was also in 1991 that I was born; and 25 years later (as a Millennial, semi-“digital native” just starting a career in the architecture industry), I find it intriguing that digital media and technology are beginning to meld with every aspect of our urban experience. But how does this impact architecture?
