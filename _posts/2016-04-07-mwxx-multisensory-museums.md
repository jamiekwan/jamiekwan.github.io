After finishing my graduate research in 2015, I decided that I wasn't finished and continued thinking, writing, and collaborating with my peers. I was fortunate to have had my project (and the co-authored papers) selected at various conferences around the world in early 2016, one of which was Museums and the Web, and I was even more lucky to have been able to attend to present it in-person. 

The museum world was hugely influential in my most formative childhood years, and I presented my thesis project as part of a panel and session on <strong>Immersive &amp; Multisensory Museum Experiences</strong>, chaired by Wendy Pryor (Head of Digital &amp; Emerging Technology at Museum Victoria, Australia). I spoke about the bottom-up approach taken in developing my prototype interactive, including how interacting with dinosaur poop (coprolite) and being slashed by a knife while wearing medieval chainmail helped me understand cultural and historical concepts in an extremely embodied and multisensory context. I tried to embed these qualities in a prototype interactive about 16th century miniature boxwood rosary beads, currently exhibited at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Metropoltan Museum of Art: artefacts that are approximately 6cm in diameter.
