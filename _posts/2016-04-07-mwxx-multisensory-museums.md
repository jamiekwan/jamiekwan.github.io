After finishing my graduate research in 2015, I found that I couldn't stop thinking and revising the way I positioned the reasearch; and continued writing and collaborating with my peers. I was fortunate to have had my project (and the co-authored papers) presented at various conferences around the world in 2016, one of which was Museums and the Web. 

The museum world was hugely influential in my most formative childhood years, and is part of the reason why I enjoy seeing how architecture and digital media come together through Experience Design. I presented my major research project as part of a panel and session on <strong>Immersive &amp; Multisensory Museum Experiences</strong>, chaired by Wendy Pryor (Head of Digital &amp; Emerging Technology at Museum Victoria, Australia). It was deeply personal, as it really saw two different parts of my life colliding among an incredible welcoming community of museum technology professionals.

I find museums fascinating as they walk the boundaries of several interest groups and missions. On one hand, they conserve culture and disseminate this knowledge to the public. They create the opportunity for visitors to engage with culture and stories surrounding artefacts. On the other, they're semi-private organizations that function as businesses, and need to take the necessary steps to keep their doors open through various programming. A lot of competing interests makes for an interesting dynamic. 

I wanted to address both of these interests by proposing a bottom-up approach to developing interactives and exhibitions: conscious of both implementation, scalability, meaning and educational impact.

The prototype I designed in grad school was a hypothetical interactive for 16th century miniature boxwood rosary beads, which are currently exhibited at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Metropoltan Museum of Art: artefacts that are approximately 6cm in diameter and often displayed behind a massive glass box. They're incredibly sensory and personal objects at the smallest scale: the owners used to hold them in their palms as a vehicle for prayer, stuff them with scented materials to facilitate contemplation. There's an amazing amount of detail in the artistry and sculpture that is evident beyond a visual level.

I spoke about the bottom-up approach taken in designing the prototype, including how interacting with dinosaur poop (coprolite) and being "slashed" by a real knife while wearing medieval chainmail as a 10-year old museum camper provided my main source of inspiration for the prototype. At the time, it helped me begin to understand cultural and historical concepts in an extremely embodied and multisensory context: I was touching fossilized poop and feeling the impact of chainmail and the protection it provided; feelings I can directly relate to in my life. Those qualities provide incredibly meaningful points of foundation for then understanding the stories behind those artefacts, and be able to connect individual cultural "nodes" to a greater context. 

For the prototype, I used microcontrollers, 3D printing, projection, speakers, and analog materials to provide information and media in multiple sensory forms based on interactions that encouraged a sense of discovery. Touching the objects in specific ways revealed specific information relevant to the semantics of the interaction (opening the object, for example), and subsequent interactions built upon the previous. Smells were embedded inside within the objects that related to both visual and audial feedback, while experientially it together attempted to put visitors into personally meditative states of controlled breathing.

I discovered that intersensory interactions (versus multisensory, to describe the relationships between the senses and not just the presence of a sensory spectrum) are deeply personal and subjective, and needs to be thought of as an overarching, and even architectural, ecosystem. And <italic><strong>that</strong></italic> subjectivity was where the educational potential was situated.
