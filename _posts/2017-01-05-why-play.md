I've been on quite the journey in the 8 years since I committed to learning the tools of being a Designer, and in figuring out exactly what that role meant. Since reading Miguel Sicart's <i>Play Matters</i> while completing my Masters research, I've seen play in a lot of different ways, and in a lot of different perspectives. Reflecting on my past as we enter 2017, I've realized that the word 'play' strangely — but almost perfectly — describes what I do professionally, and believe in as a designer.

Here's why play matters to me as a designer:

I currently work in the Creative Studio at <a href="http://www.forrec.com" target="_blank">FORREC Ltd</a>, an entertainment design company that specializes in theme parks, visitor attractions, and retail environments. At FORREC, I literally design with play! I'm fortunate to work on projects that have play components, attractions, or simply embody 'playfulness'. However, beyond theme parks and museums, I believe that play is integral in the built environment as it fosters creativity, curiosity, and story-making in every day life. Growing up in Toronto, where condo towers and high-rise development are prevalent amongst an architectural culture known for ubiquity, uniformity, and 'condominiumization' <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/802984/ubiquity-and-uniformity-why-torontos-condominiums-all-look-the-same" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>, an injection of play into the built environment can do a thing or two for Toronto urbanism. 

<b>Play has an inherent ability to foster story-telling and story-making, and can be used as a tool for connecting people with other people, with brands, and with shared beliefs and cultures. </b> It's pretty darn exciting to see this happen — in all honesty, I see "designing for play" almost synonymously as "designing for people". 

I've always been interested in designing experiences (whether physical, digital, services, or systems-based) for <i>people</i>, and I think that 'play' can really be used as a lens to see the timely intersection of digital culture with our environment, to foster a sense of community, curiosit,y and happiness.

<h4 class="article-subheading">I design through play.</h4> <!-- Design Process-->

I believe that design is incredibly broad and wide-reaching, and interesting design (aka creative thinking and innovation) grows out of playful thinking. I'm a big believer in working with <a href="http://jamiemkwan.com/ideas/2016/12/22/millennial-architects" target="_blank">wonderful weirdoes</a> and aim to think differently through incorporating play into the design process. Prototyping, iterating, and having fun, are the keys to thinking outside of the box! 

Most of the projects I'm most proud of (<a href="/projects/creative-catalyst" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="/projects/thesis" target="_blank">this</a>, and <a href="/projects/studiobud" target="_blank">this</a>) have originated from outside the 9-5 life and with people in very different roles, industries, and disciplines; from lunch-time, doing hackathons just for fun, or just from chatting over coffee! Of course, I owe this type of process to designing through play: playing with ideas outside the technical/office constraints, and playing in spaces where it's okay to fail and make mistakes, to only uncover the biggest insight into a problem or challenge! In fact, the reason I enjoy being a Designer so much is the process of uncovering solutions with people equally as passionate for creating positive change, and those people don't necessarily (and most often don't) have the same experiences as I do!

In my spare time, as a passion, I try to bring this philosophy of designing through play to Gen Z: the next biggest demographic, and quite the topic for 2017. At <a href="/projects/studiobud">Studio Bud</a>, we use the power of play and design thinking to unlock the creative potential of youth, and create a safe place for truly blue-sky ideas to form, foster, and grow. 

We're currently in the works to develop an after-school innovation lab, so here's to 2017 for the many ambitions I have on using "play" in design.
