I've been on quite the journey in the 8 years since I committed to learning the tools of being a Designer, and in figuring out exactly what that role meant. I started in Architecture, with the intentions of following "the path" towards gaining a professional license, only to end up becoming an expert in a very different (and opposite) industry, and then finally working in a multidisciplinary office, largely made up of architects.

The idea of 'play' is something that a lot of people can connect with, as it has a nostalgic feel to it. A lot of my career has been a result of fostering my creativity through play growing up, and the projects I work on have come out of simply tinkering in off-hours. I was extremely inspired by the vagueness and breadth that the term brings, and after reading Miguel Sicart's <i>Play Matters</i> (2014) while completing my Masters research, see 'play' in a lot of different ways. Now, as an experience designer in the theme park industry, I literally design for play: and alas the term has made me think about what exactly I believe in as a Designer.

I currently work in the Creative Studio at FORREC Ltd, an entertainment design company that specializes in theme parks, visitor attractions, and retail environments. Every week I work on projects that have play components, attractions, or simply embody 'playfulness' and inspire a sense of play. How I got here, and why I came to enjoy this line of work, is a bit of a longer story.

Pursuing a degree in Architecture, I always wanted to create spaces that people found value and meaning while living within.
