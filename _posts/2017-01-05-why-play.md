I've been on quite the journey in the 8 years since I committed to learning the tools of being a Designer, and in figuring out exactly what that role meant. Since reading Miguel Sicart's <i>Play Matters</i> (2014) while completing my Masters research, I've seen play in a lot of different ways, and in a lot of different perspectives. Reflecting on my past as we enter 2017, I've realized that the word 'play' strangely — but almost perfectly — describes what I do professionally, and believe in as a designer.

Here's why play matters to me as a designer:

I currently work in the Creative Studio at FORREC Ltd, an entertainment design company that specializes in theme parks, visitor attractions, and retail environments. At FORREC, I literally design with play! I'm fortunate to work on projects that have play components, attractions, or simply embody 'playfulness'. However, beyond theme parks and museums, I believe that play is integral in the built environment as it fosters creativity, curiosity, and story-making in every day life. Growing up in Toronto, where condo towers and high-rise development are prevalent amongst an architectural culture known for ubiquity, uniformity, and 'condominiumization' (<a href="http://www.archdaily.com/802984/ubiquity-and-uniformity-why-torontos-condominiums-all-look-the-same" target="_blank">PARTISANS, 2016</a>), an injection of play into the built environment can do a thing or two for Toronto urbanism. 

<b>Play has an inherent ability to foster story-telling and story-making, and can be used as a tool for connecting people with other urbanites, with brands, and with shared beliefs and cultures. </b>

I've always been interested in designing experiences (whether physical, digital, services, or systems-based) for <i>people</i>, and I think that 'play' can really be used as a lens to see the intersection of digital culture with architecture that fosters a sense of curiosity and happiness.
