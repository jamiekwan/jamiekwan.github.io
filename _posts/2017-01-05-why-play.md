I've been on quite the journey in the 8 years since I committed to learning the tools of being a Designer, and in figuring out exactly what that role meant. Since reading Miguel Sicart's <i>Play Matters</i> (2014) while completing my Masters research, I've seen play in a lot of different ways, and in a lot of different perspectives. Reflecting on my past as we enter 2017, I've realized that the word 'play' strangely — but almost perfectly — describes what I do professionally, and believe in as a designer.

Here's why play matters to me as a designer:

<br><h4 class="article-subheading">1. I design with play.</h4> <!-- Entertainment Design -->

I currently work in the Creative Studio at FORREC Ltd, an entertainment design company that specializes in theme parks, visitor attractions, and retail environments. At FORREC, I literally design with play! I'm fortunate to work on projects that have play components, attractions, or simply embody 'playfulness' and inspire a sense of play. How I got here, and why I came to enjoy this line of work, is a bit of a longer story.

Pursuing a degree in Architecture, I always wanted to create spaces that people found value and meaning while living within.

<br><h4 class="article-subheading">3. I design through play.</h4> <!-- Design Process-->
Being in a creative discipline is as fun as it probably sounded when every single designer decided to pursue it. We chose a profession of highly subjective critiques and opinions for a reason: because we get to have fun every single day. Most can probably debate against this one, but I truly believe that designing through play, and actually thinking outside the box, is what design is all about. 

At <a href="/projects/studiobud">Studio Bud</a>, we use play and design thinking to unlock the creative potential of Gen Z youth.
