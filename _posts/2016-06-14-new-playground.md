It's nearly there! I'm so excited to finally share something that has been on the drawing board for months now: my new website! I've completely overhauled my portfolio into a website hosted on Github Pages, and COMPLETELY coded by yours truly. Though to be quite honest I don't think it will ever be "complete" and will always be in a state of iteration – as it should be. But it's now serving the real purpose of being a digital playground for the work that I do.

My last website was hosted on Squarespace since 2013 – when I first finished my undergrad. I had it there for many reasons. The first being that Squarespace was an <i>awesome</i> first site to use and get my feet wet in building a website. Their templates are stunning, the backend easy to navigate and use, and it was the most efficient way to get something up and running in time for when I sent it out to prospective employers. 

In the process of making this, I learned a ton. The obvious being HTML/CSS/Javascript. I'm truly a person that learns by doing – so I took the courage of trying it out myself, reading a ton of articles, and experimenting with this site. Github offered an awesome place to do so because it was free of charge, and worked with existing open-sourced frameworks like Jekyll and Twiter Bootstrap. 

If you're into my work, keep an eye out for new things coming onto this website, where I'll explore my ideas/thoughts/philosophy through writing, code, and design.
